The history of soccer, also known as football, is rich and diverse, with origins dating back thousands of years: 
Ancient origins
The earliest known kicking game is Cuju, which was played in ancient China and closely resembles modern soccer. Similar games were also played in ancient Greece, Rome, and Japan. 
Medieval times
The first written record of a football match in England dates back to around 1170. 
19th century
The modern game of soccer originated in Britain in the 19th century. The University of Cambridge standardized the rules of play in 1843, and these "Cambridge rules" were adopted by most public schools in 1848. 
1863
The Football Association (FA) was formed in London, and the Laws of the Game were issued. The FA standardized the size and weight of the ball, and outlawed carrying the ball with the hands. 
Spread of the game
The game spread throughout Europe and across the Atlantic. Immigrants from Britain brought the game to the United States. 
Olympic sport
Soccer has been an Olympic sport since the 1900 Summer Olympic Games in Paris.
